# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. Versioning is
driven by the root [`VERSION`](./VERSION) file (see README → Releases & images).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0]

### Changed

- **The TypeScript monorepo is now the whole repo.** The `v2/` directory was
  promoted to the repo root — `apps/`, `packages/`, `dev-config/`, the compose
  files, and `Makefile` all live at the top level. The build publishes the api
  as `…/backend` and the web as `…/frontend`, the image names the smart-router
  helm chart already consumes, so no deployment change is needed.

### Removed

- **The legacy v1 stack** (`backend/` Python/FastAPI + `frontend/` Next.js) and
  its root `docker-compose*.yml` / `dev-config/`. The Quality Gate's v1
  `frontend`/`backend` jobs and the separate v2 build job are gone — a single
  build-and-push job remains. `REFACTOR-PLAN.md` (the completed rebuild plan)
  was removed.

### Added

- **Optional authentication** (`AUTH_MODE=enabled`): Auth.js v5 sign-in
  (email+password + conditional Google/GitHub/Discord), Postgres-backed users
  (new `@sr/db` package), HS256 JWT shared between web and api, idempotent
  `ADMIN_EMAIL`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` bootstrap seed, `postgres:18` compose service
  under the `auth` profile. Default stays `disabled` (open dashboard).
  See `docs/AUTH.md`.
- **Live test: full lava-specs method catalog** — generator reads the
  [lava-specs](https://github.com/Magma-Devs/lava-specs) repo and emits
  126 chain indices across jsonrpc/rest/tendermint/grpc with real
  archive/debug/trace tiers (10,600+ methods).
- Repo standard: dual license (PolyForm Noncommercial + Enterprise),
  CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CODEOWNERS, PR/issue templates,
  dependabot, banner, CI quality-gate job.

### Changed (rebuild)

- Router service pulls `ghcr.io/magma-devs/smart-router:latest` and loads
  specs straight from the lava-specs GitHub repo (no local checkout, no
  spec volume mounts).
- Default dev config is multichain (8 endpoints across 6 chains) with
  cross-validation policies enabled.
- All packages bumped to latest stable; runtime images on `node:24-alpine`.
- Branding: Magma Devs only (Lava marks removed); new banner in the
  smart-router visual family.

## [0.3.1]

Last v1-era tag — Python/FastAPI backend + Next.js frontend with HTTP basic
auth, plus the initial v2 rebuild (Fastify + Next.js 16 monorepo).
